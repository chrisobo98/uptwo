## **"What About Me? I'm Pregnant, Too!"**  

### **Soon-to-be Dad & Soon-to-be Mom**  

Did you only click the link to see how quickly the foot enters the mouth? Before you block my page, hear me out!  

:br

There’s no question that women are superheroes—handmade by God. I’m constantly in awe of my wife and all she endures with such grace. I’m such a baby when I get a minor cold that I nearly spend our mortgage money buying the entire medicine aisle at Walgreens.

:br

So, the intent of this blog isn’t to negate a woman’s sacrifice—it’s simply to highlight a few pregnancy symptoms that **non-pregnant partners** go through as well. (*I can already feel the burning eyes before even typing the rest of my thoughts.*)

## **1. The Non-Existent Non-Pregnant Partner**  

No one asks the man how *he* is doing.  

If you’re a soon-to-be **supporting** non-pregnant partner, be prepared for your emotions to be ignored when talking to family and friends.  

Almost every call is guaranteed to start with:  

> *“How is so-and-so and the baby doing?”*  

(*Cue the background music of you fading into obscurity.*)

## **2. Couvade Syndrome (Sympathetic Pregnancy)**  

Also known as **sympathetic pregnancy**, Couvade syndrome happens when the non-pregnant partner experiences similar symptoms to the pregnant woman—things like physical aches, mood swings, anxiety, and even weight gain.  

:br

Now that my baby is four months old and I’m stuck on this painful diet, I can confidently say this condition *may* be valid.  

:br

Let’s be real—who does most of the shopping in the house? Probably her. So, when pregnancy cravings hit and new snacks mysteriously appear in the shopping cart, who ends up eating **80%** of those Oreos when they make it home?  

:br

That’s right—**you**.  

:br

She has an excuse (*she’s feeding more than herself*). Without discipline, **her habits become yours.**  

:br

**Solution:** Pick up a hobby during pregnancy, like a fun Yes.Fit challenge to stay active with cool virtual reality training.

## **3. The Suppression of Emotions**  

Whether it’s stress from work or the pressure of upcoming bills, the **non-pregnant partner** often suppresses emotions to avoid adding unnecessary stress on the pregnant partner.  

:br

If left unresolved, this can lead to **depression, frustration, or aggression.**  

:br

(*You might not be carrying the baby, but that bottled-up stress isn’t weightless either.*)

## **4. Parallel Sacrifices**  

Pregnancy isn’t as one-sided as it may seem. The daily routines of **both** partners change drastically:  

- You’ll **put her socks and shoes on** when she can’t bend over.  
- When she **tosses and turns** or gets up *15 times* to pee, your sleep gets interrupted too.  
- You’ll likely take on **more household responsibilities** while she navigates pregnancy discomforts.  

The magnitude of sacrifices may not be the same, but that doesn’t mean **you’re not making any.**

## **5. Accountability Resumes Post-Pregnancy**  

Her hormones are going through rapid changes—it’s not always easy to manage emotions perfectly while juggling everything else.  

- Sensitivity levels **increase**, and your patience **will be tested.**  
- Physical discomfort can lead to **irritability**, and you might get caught in the crossfire.  
- Hurt feelings? Thick skin helps. (*You’re not the enemy—pregnancy just has mood swings.*)

## **6. The Elephant in the Mind**  

Pregnancy is a **risk** for everyone—especially for the one making the **primary** sacrifice.  

:br

Non-pregnant partners often carry silent worries about **their partner’s well-being** and feel an overwhelming responsibility for their condition.  

:br

That huge **smile and sigh of relief** you witness after delivery? It’s not just for the healthy baby being born—it’s for knowing that *you’re alive and well, too.*  

:br

(*Nine months of silent stress lifted in one breath.*)

## **Final Thoughts**  

Next time you check in on a pregnant friend or family member, it won’t hurt to ask:  

> *“And how’s the soon-to-be dad/partner doing?”*  

For the **future non-pregnant parent**—suck it up and **be there** for your significant other.  

Yes, you might be going through some things, but **her sacrifices take priority over yours** (*temporarily*).  

:br

### **Pro Tip:**

- Designate a **trusted friend** as your venting outlet (*or punching bag*).
- **Communicate openly** so your feelings don’t get completely ignored.  

Pregnancy isn’t always easy, but done correctly, these nine months can **strengthen your partnership** and make you a **better team.**
