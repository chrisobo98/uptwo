## The Person  

:br  

I grew up in a large family, which made me very family-oriented. I am fortunate to have been raised with strong values of faith, hard work, and loyalty. These lessons have stayed with me throughout my life journey and career.  

:br  

I consider myself an outgoing introvert. I am confident and articulate in controlled environments, such as during a prepared presentation, art performance, or hanging out with close friends. However, I tend to become more reserved in uncontrolled environments where I must interact, provide immediate responses, or converse with strangers. Nonetheless, I embrace both aspects of my personality—the confident and the quiet. Balancing these traits has been an important lesson for me.  

:br  

I have been passionate about two things since childhood: writing (literature, songs, and poetry) and becoming a successful businessman. I have been blessed never to stray away from my passion. Over the last 20 years, I have had a proven successful track record in both industries. In my mind, I felt like a mystic superhero, excelling in both industries without one knowing about the other. During my 17 years in corporate, only about five people may have known about my involvement in the writing industry, and it was probably the same in the writing industry. Juggling these different personas was challenging, but it allowed me to build brand names from the ground up in both sectors. Until now, it was essential to keep them separated.  

:br  

## The Businessman  

:br  

I always had an entrepreneurial mindset and believe education is crucial in business. I graduated with honors from a business school, obtaining my B.S. in Management and my M.B.A. in project management. Do you remember the person in your dorm room selling hot plates for $5? That was me, always trying to find new ways to increase my income.  

:br  

After college, I spent the next 15 years climbing the corporate ladder at multiple Fortune 500 companies. During weekends, I ran a successful open mic show in Central Florida and used my vacation time to travel the U.S. to perform and share my writing and art with thousands of people. This was an enjoyable journey when I was younger and without a family. However, once I started a family, I knew it was time to prioritize my life.  

:br  

*"Why merge now?"* you ask. When I began to delve into consulting, the two aspects started to naturally intertwine, and it felt like perfect timing. Effective brand messaging is crucial for a successful business; writing has become one of my strengths. It only made sense to use my valuable skills.  

:br  

## What does upTWo stand for?  

:br  

The name **"upTWo"** was chosen because it's simple and easy to remember. It originated from the idea of wanting to leave behind a legacy. Throughout my career working for major corporations, I always wondered, *"What do you have to show for it or leave behind?"*  

:br  

The name **"Up-Two"** has a double meaning derived from two concepts.  

:br  

1. The first is from basketball lingo, where the saying, *"We are up two now,"* indicates that the team is ahead by two points. This signifies the need to remain focused as the lead can quickly disappear. The name carries a humble yet confident meaning.  

:br  

2. The second concept refers to my two sons, suggesting that if you think I'm unique, wait until you see what God has in store for these two. I always capitalize the **"TW"** in the brand name, which is a quirky habit of mine. Although our names differ, my sons and I share the same initials. In essence, the name symbolizes the addition of two more individuals and the increased opportunities to build our legacy. It also signifies consistent victory, and when you partner with us, it's only fitting that we will win together.  

:br  

## Why did I choose my career path as a small business consultant?  

:br  

I've been involved in consulting for many years, but I fully committed to it as a career five years ago. I knew earning clients' trust as an inexperienced consultant wasn't going to be an easy task. In 2020, I officially launched my consulting business and initially offered my services for free to establish a strong reputation. After a month, I was hired on retainer by two clients. I even had to turn down a big project due to scheduling conflicts. I wanted to establish a solid reputation before I actively sought out clients.  

:br  

I believe in providing high-quality, simplified services. I've always been good at understanding complex situations and thinking strategically, but I struggled to explain my strengths to my B2B clients. I learned that B2B clients value results and clear, concise communication over showing off knowledge. So I couldn’t rush the process. I took the time to train to better align with the client's vision for their business.  

:br  

After years of seminars, book studying, and hands-on experience, I am thrilled to fully immerse myself in my client-first approach strategies to help clients' businesses excel to new levels.  

:br  

## The Class  

:br  

The client is always our top priority at **upTWo Consulting**. Our brand is built on delivering high efficiency and exclusivity, making others want to be a part of what we offer.  

:br  

What does luxury mean to you? Close your eyes and imagine what elegance looks like to you. It could be a luxury car, a high-end street in your favorite city, or a Yacht Club in the heart of Miami—whatever it is, envision it with me—got it? Great. That's how **upTWo's** brand defines itself. Not just the best, but among the best, and always striving for improvement.  

:br  

## The Mystic  

:br  

I was disappointed to learn that **Ne-Yo** wrote *"Let Me Love You"* by **Mario**. It didn't change my love for the song, but it does affect the authenticity of hearing the pain in the notes when the singer didn't write it.  

:br  

I always prefer to work behind the scenes and keep a low profile. This principle is fundamental to my work with all clients, ensuring I remain true to my brand. My clients aim to maintain their operations and draw in more customers, and my role is to help them achieve this goal.  

:br  

I strive to improve client relationships and identify opportunities to attract new ones. With reliable scheduling and respect for clients' time, **upTWo** aims to complete tasks without drawing attention. We ensure we do not hinder day-to-day operations and try to move as invisibly as possible.  

:br  

## Conclusion  

:br  

The entire business structure is built around a client-first approach. I created this blog not because I wanted to but because I believe it's essential for clients to know who they are partnering with. Transparency, honesty, commitment, and hard work are integral to my character. Clients of **upTWo Consulting** are guaranteed a high level of commitment.  

:br  

Our reputation is exceptional because we are passionate about what we do at **upTWo Consulting**, and our competitive advantage lies in our determination to win for our clients.  

:br  

I’m a big dreamer, so I love working with business-to-business clients. To run a thriving business, you must be a big dreamer, which makes me feel like I’m amongst my peers. Let's continue to dream and work together to reach new heights!
