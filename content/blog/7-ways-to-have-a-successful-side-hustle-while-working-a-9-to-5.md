**2nd income ideas / ways to make more money / side hustles**  

## Are you happy with your current job?  

Do you have more free time and want to find a new side hustle? Are you in the transition stage of leaving your 9 to 5 to pursue your passion? Are you trying to create a perfect balance between your career and passion? If you have any questions, this blog intends to ensure you are on the right track. I want to inspire you to pursue your passion and add a few extra clicks for my SEO as I follow my own. Honestly, I fell between the transition stage and creating a perfect balance. My success vehicle got stuck in the transition gear for 10 years, but I am not counting.  

My passion has always been writing music. I have been writing all music genres since my earliest childhood memories. It was only natural that when I landed my career job, I continued writing music on the side. Imagine dating women who were career driven, trying to explain why I work for a Fortune 500 company and compose music on the side. The petty side-eyes were endless, and the “he must be going through a midlife crisis” vibes were real. Your desire for the perfect balance will not always be understood. Everyone perceives the world differently, but I will provide my slanted views (examples) to encourage everyone who continues to read beyond this point.

## The 7 Ways  

### 1. Create discipline by organizing your thoughts: The power of writing it down and notating the “ah-ha moment."  

- The power of note-taking is about managing the beast that could be your thoughts.  
- Write down your ideas and make a special notation of your “ah-ha moments.”  
- Use apps like Microsoft OneNote, text yourself ideas, or use your phone's notepad to capture spontaneous genius.

Tony, an aspiring comedian, was hanging with friends and randomly said a joke that instantly made everyone laugh. His friends started adding to it. That is the “ah-ha moment.” Write it down!

### 2. Build and maintain momentum: What could you be doing “in the meantime?”  

- Momentum has won as many games as skill and technique in any sport.  
- Don’t let minor setbacks discourage you from your goals.  
- Keep momentum by completing other tasks while waiting on pending ones.

Mike stopped making music due to financial struggles. His friend reminded him, “Yeah, but you can still be writing.” Mike knew his friend was right but was too proud to admit it.

### 3. Be honest with yourself: Confront your fears and remove them as barriers to success

- If you're not honest with yourself, you're running on a treadmill.  
- Acknowledge and work around your fears instead of ignoring them.

### 4. Adapt processes, solutions, and knowledge acquired at work to manage your passion and home life

- Creating work-life balance is a major challenge.  
- Merge similar projects to save time and effort.

### 5. Prioritize your happiness: Celebrate the small wins

- Don’t put your happiness at the bottom of the priority list.  
- Celebrate small wins and create moments of joy.

Train yourself to be happy. Even after a rough day, reward yourself with small joys like watching your favorite show after completing personal projects.

### 6. Measure your progress toward achieving your goals: Accountability check

- Track and monitor progress with weekly, monthly, and yearly checkpoints.  
- Even if progress is slow, stay consistent with check-ins.

### 7. Ask someone who is doing or has done what you want to do

- Surround yourself with people who align with your goals.  
- Check your ego—humility leads to success.

## Conclusion  

Find something that drives you. Study it. Write down your ideas. If your passion brings you peace, protect it.  

**Slanted View:**  
Creatives struggle with managing ideas. Instead of jumping from one to another, box in your ideas. Focus on one project at a time and see it through.  

Without planning and staying focused, pursuing your passion while working a 9 to 5 will be difficult. However, once you master balance, it will become easier. Find your freedom and be great at it!
