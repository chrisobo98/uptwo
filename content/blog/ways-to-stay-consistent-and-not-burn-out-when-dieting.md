## Why Can't I Stick To My Diet?  

:br  

Whether getting in shape in two weeks for vacation, making better/healthier lifestyle choices, or losing a few pounds before the wedding day, we all have reasons for wanting to eat healthier.  

:br

## Ways to Make a Flavorful Transition into a Healthy Lifestyle  

:br  

### **Small Steps – Don’t Lie to Yourself**  

:br  

Making the mistake of aggressively attacking the diet initially can result in burnout. We all fall victim to running to the scale and the mirror to see results after eating one salad and hitting the gym on day one. The goal is to be better than yesterday, not have a *Baywatch* body by day two.  

:br  

Small steps could include:  

- Setting a goal to not eat after 7 PM (*if feasible for work/life balance*).  
- Cutting out red meat for the week.  

:br  

Good new habits must replace old bad ones to make lifestyle changes. However, Rome wasn’t built overnight—be patient with your journey.

### **Lose the Ego (No Longer the Old You)**  

:br  

In the words of the great rapping philosopher 50 Cent:  

:br  

> “Damn homie, in high school you were the man homie. The f^&^ happened to you!?”  

:br  

In short, let go of your glory days and build from where you are now.  

:br

### **Plan for Impulse Eating**  

:br  

As a world-renowned snacker, I can admit this is my biggest struggle.  

:br  

*Picture this:* You ate healthy all day, only to get stuck in traffic and now you’re hungry. Suddenly, every fast-food restaurant is waving at you as you pass by. Eventually, you cave because *“One large fry won’t hurt.”*  

:br  

Sound familiar?  

:br  

An alternative is to **plan ahead** by packing snacks like fruits, granola bars, and nuts in advance. You’ll be surprised how effectively this can deter you from eating out and spending extra money.  

:br

### **Fail Up (Include It in Your Consciousness)**  

:br  

We often plan on starting a diet, but never really plan on how we might quit it.  

:br  

Why is that?  

:br  

Most people never finish a complete diet program in its entirety. Be honest with yourself—there will be days when you can’t get out of bed or work drains all your energy. One missed day quickly turns into four months since you've been back to the gym or on a diet.  

:br  

I follow a simple rule:  

:br  

- If I don’t work out, I **must** eat healthy, and vice versa.  

:br  

It doesn’t always go as planned, but keeping it in my consciousness keeps me balanced and never too far off my weight goals.  

:br

## **Conclusion**  

:br  

I am a foodie. I travel for food. I wake up thinking about each meal before even brushing my teeth.  

:br  

However, **unconscious eating** will eventually take a toll on your mind, body, and spirit. Most people equate giving up a good burger or steak for a salad to death (*I was one of those people for years*).  

:br  

Over the last few years, my wife and I (*mostly my wife*) have found flavorful alternatives that still satisfy our taste buds. Changing your mindset can help eradicate bad eating habits and make healthier choices feel effortless.

- Apple slices with peanut butter  

:br  

### **Lunch Ideas:**
