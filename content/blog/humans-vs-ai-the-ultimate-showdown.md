## **The Power of AI | ChatGPT**

:br

## **Introduction**

During my junior year of college, I had my first statistics class, where the professor introduced a new concept. He announced that the traditional statistics course would not be held that semester; instead, we would learn statistics through an Excel spreadsheet. At that time, my younger, overly confident self thought, ‚ÄúCool!‚Äù The material was new, so I didn‚Äôt face much of a learning curve. However, the grad students and seniors were in uproar over this change. For weeks, they expressed their frustrations about the new method of teaching statistics. I lacked empathy for their concerns and considered them to be overreacting.

Throughout my successful 18-year corporate career, my Excel skills became the cornerstone of my professional advancements, enabling me to simplify raw data for stakeholders. Data analytics has been providing for my family for many years. Fast-forward 20 years from that junior year, I find myself as the older, stubborn individual complaining about Artificial Intelligence and its impact on job security, particularly in data analytics.

I recall being assigned significant projects and spending countless nights and weekends finishing them, sometimes taking three to four months. Now, AI tools like Power BI can process that data in seconds with just the click of a button. I wondered where I fit in now and how I would survive in this rapidly changing environment. Should I pivot careers? These thoughts raced through my mind as AI advanced in the corporate world.

### **Artificial Intelligence | ChatGPT**  

As a passionate writer, I had vowed never to use AI. I always believed that it couldn‚Äôt match human emotion, only predict it. I resisted its emergence and pushed it aside for as long as I could. However, after networking with industry leaders in the copywriting field, I realized I would be left behind if I didn‚Äôt adapt and keep up.

Much like the older students in my statistics class, I felt threatened by rapid change. If you‚Äôre reading this, I have great news for you! I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm the one advocating for AI, especially since I‚Äôm late to the party, but I‚Äôm here to tell you it‚Äôs time for a mindset shift. It‚Äôs time to view AI as a tool and not a threat!

I conducted extensive research as I began to accept its presence and realized it was here to stay. I studied Artificial Intelligence to understand how it reshapes industries and its limitations. One CEO of a Fortune 500 company provided an inspiring perspective that I hope can change your mind for the better about its arrival.

## **The CEO‚Äôs Perspective on AI in the Workforce**

The CEO reassured the audience not to fear AI, emphasizing that it won‚Äôt eliminate jobs in the long term. While there may be initial disruptions in the job market, consider this: if AI's main goal is to increase productivity, who will oversee the significant rise in production? The answer is humans.

For instance, if your warehouse used to produce 1,500 products a day, with the integration of AI, that number could increase to 45,000 products daily. This significant boost in production means that companies will either need to invest more in AI tools to manage this increased output or hire more human staff to oversee the process. In summary, someone needs to operate the machinery. While there may be some learning curves and potential layoffs during this transition, the situation will stabilize over time, and human workers will continue to be essential in the workforce.
